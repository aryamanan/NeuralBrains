Please check out our updated_pdf.pptx file for all new updates we made on 10th october (extended day), we missed update submission option on 10th october by 1 minute, we humbly apologise for that. We've added text.csv for the text classification task which contains predicted_primary_reasons for each call_id in the original test.csv file that was provided in the hackathon.

All source code regarding text classification task and AST / AHT minimization analysis is available here.
